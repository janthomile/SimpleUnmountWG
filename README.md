# SimpleUnmountWorldGuard

## Dependencies
* WorldGuard
* WorldEdit

## Features
Adds a single region flag to worldguard, `unmount`, which when set to `true` forces players to unmount when they enter the region or try to ride an entity.
Players with the permission node, `simpleunmount.bypass` are not affected by this flag.
### !!!Incompatible with the `ride` flag! `ride` must be `true` for this plugin's flag to work!!!
